The website is to promote the client's product. The video game Welcome home. The website will have a developer blog,
game info, and a game download section. The purpose of the website is to increase product awareness. The website will
be targeted at indie game players between the ages of 18-32. The client will be able to measure the success of the website 
through game downloads from the site and site visitors. The client currently doesn't have a website for their product. They 
have worked with designers before. Mainly with the designer Michael Konstansky and they had an undisputable amazing experience. 
The client has provided me with a few assets including a video trailer.
